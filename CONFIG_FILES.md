# Configuration Files Explained

This document explains the purpose of each configuration file in the MCP-Svelte5-Docs project.

## package.json

The `package.json` file is the heart of any Node.js project. It:
- Defines the project metadata (name, version, description)
- Lists dependencies and their versions
- Defines scripts for building, testing, and running the project
- Configures npm-specific settings like the files to include in the published package

In this project, it defines:
- The project name (`mcp-svelte5-docs`)
- Dependencies like the MCP SDK, OpenAI client, and Axios
- Scripts for building and running the server
- Configuration for npm publishing

## package-lock.json

The `package-lock.json` file is automatically generated by npm. It:
- Locks down the exact versions of all dependencies and their dependencies
- Ensures consistent installations across different environments
- Improves installation speed by providing a pre-computed dependency tree

This file should be committed to version control but never edited manually.

## tsconfig.json

The `tsconfig.json` file configures the TypeScript compiler. It:
- Specifies which files to compile
- Sets the JavaScript version to target
- Configures type checking strictness
- Defines output directory for compiled files

In this project, it's configured to:
- Compile TypeScript files from the `src` directory
- Output compiled JavaScript to the `build` directory
- Use ES2022 features
- Enable strict type checking

## .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file tells Git which files and directories to ignore. It:
- Prevents unnecessary files from being committed to the repository
- Excludes build artifacts, dependencies, and environment-specific files
- Keeps the repository clean and focused on source code

In this project, it ignores:
- `node_modules` directory (dependencies)
- `build` directory (compiled output)
- Temporary files and logs
- Environment variable files

## .npmignore

The `.npmignore` file tells npm which files to exclude when publishing the package. It:
- Reduces the size of the published package
- Excludes files that aren't needed for using the package
- Can override `.gitignore` for npm-specific behavior

In this project, it excludes:
- Source files (since we publish only the compiled JavaScript)
- Test files
- Configuration examples
- Git-specific files

## LICENSE

The `LICENSE` file contains the legal terms under which the software is distributed. This project uses the MIT License, which:
- Allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute the software
- Requires the license and copyright notice to be included
- Provides no warranty or liability
- Is one of the most permissive open-source licenses

## claude_desktop_config.example.json

This is an example configuration file for Claude Desktop. It:
- Shows how to configure Claude Desktop to use this MCP server
- Provides a template that users can copy and modify
- Demonstrates the required structure and parameters

Users should copy this file to their Claude Desktop configuration directory and modify it with their specific paths and API keys.

## test-retrieval.js and test-retrieval.sh

These files are used for testing the OpenAI Retrieval API integration:
- `test-retrieval.js` contains the JavaScript code that tests the API
- `test-retrieval.sh` is a shell script that runs the test with the proper environment variables

They help verify that:
- The OpenAI API key is valid
- The vector store exists or can be created
- The search functionality works correctly
